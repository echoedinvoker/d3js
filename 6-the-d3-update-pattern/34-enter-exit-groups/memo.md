## **Prepare the experiments**

![check num of docs in firestore](./pic/01.png) 

![focus on observing rects object](./pic/02.png)

## **Selection.data() return**

### _if there is no existed rects in DOM_

![no existed rects in DOM](./pic/03.png) 

### _num of existed rects more than docs in firestore_

![docs more than existed rects in DOM](./pic/04.png) 

### _num of docs in firestore more than existed rects_

![existed rects in DOM more than docs in firestore](./pic/05.png) 

## **Conclusion**

- _enter is for virtual elements (not in DOM)

- _exit is for removing elements in DOM

- _group is for elements, which is already in DOM
